# Calculator
Part of the Odin Project Foundation Course

For finishing this project I used the following skills:
- html, css and javascript
- linking a stylesheet, a scriptsheet and a google web-font to the html-file
- styling the calculator using flexbox and google web-font
- manipulating the DOM using javascript, e.g. showing the calculations on the display
- adding keydown and click events
- creating multiple functions for an easier understanding of the code
- including multiple special events, e.g. division by zero, pressing = before enough arguments, handling of negative values, multiple dots
